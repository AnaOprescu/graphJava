Description:  In this project, we tried to creat a  Graph as an interface, whose aim is to solve graph's problems, having mixed another a class Edge, from where we have inheritated 2 other sous-classes UndirectedEdge and DirectedEdge and a separate class called Vertex. To make sure that it runs out correctly we have also created the class TestGraph.
